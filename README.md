# SI507-project1

# This project asks users to enter their own queries and receive a list of medias from iTunes which are grouped into Songs, Movies, and Other Medias, and have access to more detailed information if they want.

# When the program first runs, the user should be presented with two options: enter a search term, or enter exit to quit. After a query has been run, a third option becomes available: launch preview. To launch a preview, the user enters the number of the result they want to preview. The program will then use the webbrowser module to open the trackViewURL embedded in the JSON item description, while also printing the URL to the screen.
